# chatbot
ðŸ¤– chatbot built with react, dialogflow api.ai integration, pusher, firebase, express, custom ui (work in progess)

After attending a workshop creating apps for Actions at Google's Women Techmakers, I was inspired to dive deeper into Dialogflow, formerly API.ai

This app is built with a React frontend where a user sends and receives messages, and an Express server where messages are processed by the chat api

To run server, (port 5000) `node server.js`
Open up another terminal to run frontend, `cd react-bot` then `npm i && npm start`
